The TRIPI dataset aims to be a complete overview of the scope of transportation infrastructure + the stocks of materials currently in this infrastructure. The code supplied here provides ways to convert, extract and calculate data from files provided by OpenStreetMaps and Geofabrik. Using this data allows for a highly detailed coverage of transportation infrastructure.

## üõ£Ô∏è: What's TRIPI?
Construction materials are associated with significant environmental and resources impacts. The circular use of materials already in-use as stocks may provide an opportunity to reduce these impacts. We provide a dataset describing the potential global urban mine consisting of transportation infrastructure in an open database based on geospatial data from OpenStreetMaps. We reveal the significant opportunities of the embedded materials in this huge stock. With this Total Resources in Physical Infrastructure, or TRIPI, database we provide easy access to a global dataset covering 175 countries and sub-regions, allowing researchers to select an area of study, and find the location as well as material composition of the physical infrastructure. Material stocks are reported on a national level and commonly used regional aggregations. Material stocks are reported per kg, kg per capita, and kg per area; and for the physical type of infrastructure that is available in kilometers and area (km2). This dataset can be used in various research applications such as Material Flow Analysis, Material stock inventories, Country level comparisons of infrastructure density, and others, and inform policy on harnessing the opportunities of the urban mine.
